## FS Data

FS Data is a full-stack project that aims to display simple data from a team based on their progress. The colors are randomized since the project can have multiple registered users. The data is persisted through the database, and both the front-end and back-end communicate through endpoints.

## Frontend

The frontend part of FS Data was developed using Typescript and deployed on Netlify. You can check the website by clicking this [link](https://fsstack.netlify.app/). The website has been stylized using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI, with additional features like Toastify, React-icons, and React-minimal-pie-chart.

## Backend

The backend part of FS Data was created in Golang, with a Dockerfile created for deployment on Google Cloud Run. You can check the backend documentation [here](https://github.com/carlosarraes/fsback). Go-chi was used to develop the backend.
